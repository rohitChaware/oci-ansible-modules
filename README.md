# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Ansible Modules

## About

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Ansible Modules provide an easy way to create and provision resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) through Ansible. These modules allow you to author Ansible playbooks that help you automate the provisioning and configuring of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services and resources, such as Compute, Load Balancing, Database, and other Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services.

**Services supported**
- Block Volume
- Compute
- IAM
- Load Balancing
- Networking
- Object Storage
- Database

The OCI Ansible modules are built using the [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Python SDK](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/API/SDKDocs/pythonsdk.htm). The OCI Ansible modules honour the [SDK configuration](https://docs.us-phoenix-1.oraclecloud.com/Content/ToolsConfig.htm) when available.

## Installation

See the [getting started guide](https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/ansiblegetstarted.htm) for instructions on using the installer script to install the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Ansible Modules and its prerequisites in your host/Ansible controller node.

## Samples

This project includes a catalog of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Ansible module samples that illustrate using the modules to carry out common infrastructure provisioning and configuration tasks in the `samples` directory. The samples are organized in groups associated with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services:
- Block Volume
- Compute
- Database
- IAM
- Load Balancing
- Object Storage

Begin by reviewing the Readme.md file that you will find in each sample's root directory.
